### 🧠 What Is It?

Welcome to the **dark side** of game prediction.
This is no ordinary Aviator tool – it's an **AI-powered multiplier prophet** lurking in the code shadows.
Built with a **LSTM Neural Network**, it scrapes real-time data from the 1Win Aviator realm and dares to whisper what the next multiplier might be...

> ⚰️ Live predictions
> ☠️ Neural learning from the past
> 🎲 Twists of randomness await...
